This repository includes an /airflow directory containing DAG files used for data drift monitoring, report generation, and model retraining.

In a production-scale MLOps setup, Airflow is typically deployed as a separate orchestration environment — often on its own server, container, 
or cloud instance — rather than being part of the same codebase as the core model or API.

The Airflow DAGs are included here for demonstration and reproducibility purposes only, to show how the orchestration layer integrates 
with the ML components in this project (e.g., MLflow, Prometheus, and Evidently).

When setting this project up, install airflow separately and make a /data folder to store the historical and recent data.
Also add these two files to the /dags folder.
